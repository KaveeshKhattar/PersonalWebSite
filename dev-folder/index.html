                        I successfully achieved the creation of Solan, a web application fostering 
                        learning through collaborative question bank creation. 
                        Under the guidance of a Cisco mentor, I worked with a team of five classmates, 
                        to deliver a powerful platform that promotes knowledge acquisition through crowdsourcing. 
                        Solan helped 50 of my classmates in the revision of concepts before every unit 
                        test which led to an average increase of 3 marks per test. Visit it here:
